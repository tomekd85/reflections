What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git directory is created in the cwd with all the meta-data needed by git to
track changes in my program

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the proxy layer between cwd and repository. It contains all
changes which will be commited in next commit command but can still be removed
before the commit.
